# Coli_oligopool_prom_rbs_library_generator_single
This script analyzes combinatorial DNA library data from Kosuri et al. (9 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1301301110) to filter, select, and prepare diverse sequence variants for oligopool ordering. It performs comprehensive quality control, diversity analysis, and generates ready-to-order sequences with cloning sites.
